## So, yet another tour library?

**No**, it's more than a tour library. **Tours are just one of the many use-cases**. Driver.js can be used wherever you need some sort of overlay for the page; some common usecases could be: [highlighting a page component](https://i.imgur.com/TS0LSK9.png) when user is interacting with some component to keep them focused, providing contextual help e.g. popover with dimmed background when user is filling a form, using it as a focus shifter to bring user's attention to some component on page, using it to simulate those "Turn off the Lights" widgets that you might have seen on video players online, usage as a simple modal, and of-course product tours etc.

Driver.js is written in Vanilla TypeScript, has zero dependencies and is highly customizable. It has several options allowing you to change how it behaves and also **provides you the hooks** to manipulate the elements as they are highlighted, about to be highlighted, or deselected.

> Also, comparing the size of Driver.js with other libraries, it's the most light-weight, it is **just ~5kb gzipped** while others are 12kb+.
